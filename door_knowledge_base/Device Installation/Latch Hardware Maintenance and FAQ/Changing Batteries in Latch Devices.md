<p>To determine your device's remaining battery percentage, open the DOOR App, navigate to 'Access', and select the door name. We recommend performing a Door Sync first (tap 'Sync' and then 'Sync' again) to ensure you are seeing the most up-to-date battery reading. Then, go back to the device page and select 'Device Details,' where you can see your device's battery reading. </p>
<h3 id="h_01HNK4JTVGNKJHE3RG5RJ1CMEB">How long can I expect the batteries in my Latch device to last?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Latch M's batteries should last 12 months under normal usage with 6 x AA Duracell non-rechargeable batteries.</li>
<li>The Latch C2’s batteries should last 24 months under normal usage with 6 x AA Duracell non-rechargeable batteries.  </li>
<li>The Latch C1’s batteries should last roughly 9 months under normal usage with 6 x AA Duracell non-rechargeable batteries.  </li>
<li>The e-Genius Powered by Latch's batteries should last 18 months under normal usage with 6 x AA Duracell non-rechargeable batteries.  </li>

<p>If you don't manage your own Latch device, please request that your property manager change the batteries of your device to avoid any damage. If you do manage your own Latch device, below are the steps to change the batteries for your device. For all Latch devices, you'll also want to follow this guidance for battery changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace ALL 6 AA batteries with new batteries of the same brand. Mixing and matching new and old batteries can cause battery failure and reduced battery life.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform a Door Sync using the DOOR App immediately after changing the batteries. Failing to sync the device with the DOOR App after battery replacement can result in unreliable functionality or a disruption in guest access.</span></li>
</ul>
