<p>Latch M, Latch C, and Latch C2 are battery-powered and will continue working during a property-wide power outage. If your M Series (Generation 2) is wired and there is a power outage, it will switch to battery power automatically and revert to wired power when the power is restored.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1D51166SQCF6KQMFQT0ZWM4">Latch R</h3>
<p>Latch R needs a constant power supply to function. We recommend a backup power source for R devices to avoid losing functionality during an outage.Â </p>
<p>If power sources change and when power is restored, it is crucial to promptly update the reader to avoid disruptions to guest access and schedules.</p>
<p><strong>Fail-safe and fail-secure</strong></p>
<p>Proper wiring and programming of the R device are essential to ensure it behaves as a fail-safe (unlocked) or fail-secure (locked) during a power loss, depending on the hardware.</p>
<p>We recommend seeking guidance from your property installer for assistance with these settings.</p>
