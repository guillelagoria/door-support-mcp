<p>Managing battery life at your property, whether one Latch device or many, is easy.</p>

<p><strong>Property Management:</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Portfolio Manager or a property manager with device management permissions, you can expect to receive low battery notifications when devices at your property fall below a specific battery level, depending on the device type and assuming normal usage. Specifically, for the devices running on Firmware starting with G (C2, eGenius, Latch M), you will receive alerts when <span class="il">battery</span> levels drop below 20%; M devices and C devices not running on G Firmware will send Low Battery Alerts at 15%.</p>
<p>If you'd like to check the battery life at your property, you may pull an Access Devices report via Reports at your <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://app.door.com">DOOR OS</a></span></strong> or view the battery percentages in the DOOR App by selecting a door. </p>
<p><strong>Residents:</strong></p>
<p>In the DOOR App, residents can expect to see a yellow tag "Low battery" next to "Device details" when the device's battery has fallen below 15%. </p>
