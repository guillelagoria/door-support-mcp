<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see an error message that says “Could not connect to Latch” on the intercom's interface, it means that the intercom is most likely having difficulty connecting to the internet. Check your Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection. Usually, the Latch Intercom will fall back to cellular, but if there is a poor cellular signal or if cellular has been disabled for your building, you will need to check your Wi-Fi or Ethernet and reconfigure them using the DOOR App.</span></p>
