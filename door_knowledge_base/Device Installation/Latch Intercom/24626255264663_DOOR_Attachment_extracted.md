Dampen  a soft cloth to wipe the exterior of the device. Do not use solvents or abrasives   that might damage or discolor the device.  Cleaning the screen: Although the device is water resistant, do not apply water or liquid directly to the screen. Dampen a clean, soft, microfiber cloth with water and then wipe the screen gently. Cleaning the speaker mesh: To clean out debris from the speaker mesh perforations, use a can of compressed air held 3‚Äù from the surface. For particles that are not removed by compressed air, painters tape can be used on the surface to pull out debris.  Water Resistance  Although the device is water resistant, do not apply water or liquid to the device, especially from  a pressure washer or hose.  Magnetic Fields  The device may induce magnetic fields near the surface of the device strong enough to affect  objects such as credit cards and storage media.  Important Handling Information
