Latch // Runbook  v.1.1 August 2023  Best Practices and Field Notes  Best Practices  1.   Use Provided Hardware  a.   Use mounting screws provided where possible. If using di ff erent mounting  screws, use #6   fl at-head screws.  2.   Preparation is Key!  a.   Drill the correctly sized hole and necessary depth for wires to avoid mounting  di ffi culties.  3.   Don‚Äôt Force It  a.   Use care when mounting the reader on the backplate to avoid damage. 4.  Handle With Care  b.   Avoid letting the intercom hang vertically by the tether while working on it.  Hanging the unit from the tether may result in it swinging free and damaging the  exterior.  Field Notes  1.   The most common issues experienced with the camera and intercom units are:  a.   Firewall blocking port tra ffi c.  b.   Insu ffi cient bandwidth allocation.  2.   If the paired R is not connected to the internet directly - then it must be manually  updated using the Latch App or Manager App in order to ensure the user ledger is  updated. If the user ledger is not updated, then the Intercom cannot unlock it.  3.   The network must provide at least 2Mb/s download and upload speeds for the intercom  to function properly.  4.   Currently, the intercom does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks.  5.   Intercom Internet Connectivity Status in the Manager App can be a bit confusing  since R‚Äôs can be internet connection as well.  3

Latch // Runbook  v.1.1 August 2023  Advanced Technical Support Guide  NOTE:   If the below troubleshooting steps do not resolve your issue, please reach out to  Support@latch.com and our Support Team will be happy to assist you.  Latch Intercom - Intercom Requirements  Pairing the Intercom with a Door  ‚óè   The Latch Intercom uses the Latch R to unlock doors and cannot unlock a door  directly. To pair an Intercom with a door, you must use the Manager App and  follow the below steps:  ‚óã   Once the intercom has been mounted and powered on, you may scan  the QR code that shows on the display using the Manager App.  ‚óã   Scan the QR code located on the intercom or on the packaging and  select the correct location.  ‚óã   After setting the location, you will have the option to pair the intercom  with the doors that Latch Operations has designated as ‚ÄòIntercom Doors.‚Äô  ‚óã   Once paired, you can connect the intercom to the internet.  Power Requirements  Note: Latch does not recommend directly using PoE switches with less than 50W  per port with the intercom. If a PoE switch with less than 50W per port is being  used, then PoE should be disabled for the port or the connection should be  moved. Using both 2-wire and PoE concurrently for redundancy is still okay if the  PoE port can support 50W.  ‚óè   Detailed speci fi cations around PoE / connecting the intercom by ethernet are as  follows:  ‚óã   Latch recommends using 24V instead of 12V whenever possible. If the  installer is only able to use 12V, they must ensure the wire length and  gauge are correct   per the chart in the installation guide (also shown  below).  8

Latch // Runbook  v.1.1 August 2023  ‚óã   Amperage is 4A @ 12V or 2A @ 24V  ‚óã   The power supply must be a Class 2 Isolated, UL Listed DC Power Supply  Network Requirements  ‚óè   Ethernet switch with PoE ports  ‚óã   The intercom should NOT be connected to any PoE-enabled port other than a  dedicated PoE injector. If connecting to a PoE port, not an injector, see the  below bullets for detailed speci fi cations.  ‚ñ†   The ethernet switch must be a PoE++ switch that supports the 802.3bt  IEEE standard. This will ensure that 50W is available at each port.  ‚óè   Example: this Netgear GS516UP has eight PoE++ ports  ‚ñ†   If a PoE switch with less than 50W per port is being used, then PoE  should be disabled for the port or the connection should be moved.  ‚óè   Switch with multiple con fi gurations/combination camera + intercom setups  ‚óã   Using PoE power and 2-wire concurrently  ‚ñ†   Using both 2-wire and PoE concurrently for redundancy is still okay if the  PoE port can support 50W (see below).  ‚óã   Switch that has some PoE ports and some non-PoE ports  ‚ñ†   A camera and an intercom could be connected to the same PoE switch  but with each port con fi gured with di ff erent settings. For example, a  camera could be connected to a switch port with 802.3at power (<50W  available) with the intercom on a non-PoE port that satis fi es the 50W  power requirement.  ‚óã   Switch that has di ff erent types of PoE ports (some PoE+ ports and some PoE++  ports)  ‚ñ†   The camera could be connected to a switch port with 802.3at power  (<50W available) with the intercom on an 802.3bt power (>50W available)  PoE++ port.  9

Latch // Runbook  v.1.1 August 2023  ‚óã   Switch that has all PoE ports but has SW control to disable PoE per port  ‚ñ†   It is very important for installers to disable PoE for Intercom‚Äôs port to  ensure they don‚Äôt end up with an underrated PoE source.  Latch Intercom - Network Troubleshooting  Note: The network must provide at least 2Mb/s download and upload speeds for  the intercom to function properly.  Also, Intercom Internet Connectivity Status in the Manager App can be a bit  confusing since R‚Äôs can be internet connection as well. See the images below for  clari fi cation.  10
