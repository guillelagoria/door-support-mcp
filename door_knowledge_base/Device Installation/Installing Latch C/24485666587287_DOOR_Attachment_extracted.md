(A)   Federal Communications Commission Statement  This device complies with FCC Rules Part 15. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:  •   This device may not cause harmful interference.  •   This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.  (B)   This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a class B digital device, pursuant to  Part 15 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable  protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio  frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference  to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If  this equipment causes harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the  equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by doing one or more of the following  measures:  •   Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.  •   Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.  •   Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.  •   Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help  (C)   Radiation Exposure Statement:  This equipment must be installed and operated in accordance with provided instructions and the antenna(s) used for  this transmitter must be installed to provide a separation distance of at least 20 cm from all persons and must not be  co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter.  (A)   Radio Frequency (RF) Exposure Information  The radiated output power of the Wireless Device is below the Industry Canada (IC) radio frequency exposure limits. The  Wireless Device should be used in such a manner such that the potential for human contact during normal operation is  minimized. This device has been evaluated for and shown compliant with the IC Specific Absorption Rate (“SAR”) limits  when installed in specific host products operated in portable exposure conditions.  Canada’s REL (Radio Equipment List) can be found at the following web address:  http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/sitt/reltel/srch/nwRdSrch.do?lang=eng  Additional Canadian information on RF exposure also can be found at the following web address:  http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08792.html  (B)   Canada, avis d’Industrie Canada (IC)  Cet appareil numérique de classe B est conforme aux normes canadiennes ICES-003 et RSS-247.  Son fonctionnement est soumis aux deux conditions suivantes: (1) cet appareil ne doit pas causer d’interférence et (2)  cet appareil doit accepter toute interférence, notamment les interférences qui peuvent affecter son fonctionnement.  L’identifiant  Informations concernant l’exposition aux fréquences radio (RF)  La puissance de sortie émise par cet appareil sans fil est inférieure à la limite d’exposition aux fréquences radio d’  Industrie Canada (IC). Utilisez l’appareil sans fil de façon à minimiser les contacts humains lors du fonctionnement  normal.  Ce périphérique a été évalué et démontré conforme aux limites SAR (Specific Absorption Rate – Taux d’absorption  spécifique) d’ IC lorsqu’il est installé dans des produits hôtes particuliers qui fonctionnent dans des conditions  d’exposition à des appareils  portables.  Ce périphérique est homologué pour l’utilisation au Canada.
