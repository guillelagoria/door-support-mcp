<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice your Latch C device's deadbolt is repeatedly extending and retracting, it's possible the device detects a jam.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01J1ZJ14NZ6WFGNEJRAW89MAY8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens during a jam?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Latch C detects a jam (an inability to sufficiently extend the deadbolt), it performs an anti-jamming routine where it retracts and extends the deadbolt three additional times to give the user an opportunity to take corrective action. After the anti-jamming routine, the Latch C either indicates that it was successfully locked with a locking animation on the Lens, or that the locking attempt was unsuccessful with a double-blink animation on the Lens. If you see that locking was successful, please still test your door to ensure that the door is secure. If the locking was unsuccessful, simply unlock to retract the deadbolt and try locking again. </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01J1ZJ14NZ8NBKF43CW36FD0WT"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure you have closed the door the whole way.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On some doors, it will be necessary for you to pull or push on the door while locking to ensure that the deadbolt is aligned with the door frame. This can be for a number of reasons, but it may be because there is weather-stripping material installed to create a good seal between your door and doorframe to better insulate your home.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01J1ZJ14P0GVFCW058N0FN23NC"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your door alignment.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important that the Latch C locks and unlocks smoothly. The resistance felt when locking and unlocking with the thumb turn is the same resistance the motor encounters. Long-term, this will reduce your Latch Câ€™s battery life and can cause additional wear and tear. If you feel that there is unusual resistance, contact your property management for guidance.</span></p>
