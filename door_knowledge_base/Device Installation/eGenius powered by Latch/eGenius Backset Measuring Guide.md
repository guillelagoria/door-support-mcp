<p>In order to help inform the correct deadbolt backset length for your eGenius order, we highly recommend that you measure 1% of the doors at your building (there must be at least 10 doors) and note the backset length of each door. This can then inform your order allocation and backset length split (e.g. 100% 2 ⅜”, 50% 2 ⅜” 50% 2 ¾”, etc.) At least one of every door types receiving an eGenius interconnect lock should be measured (e.g. main unit entrance, secondary unit entrance, and any other doors that will receive this lock). For garden-style communities, a sampling of doors from each building should be measured.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tape measure</li>
<li>Straight edge (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J1WKQM41XGWW60FY11GKE4R6">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the door you intend to measure.</li>
<li>Hook the tape measure around the edge of the door as shown in the picture below.</li>
<li>Measure the distance from the edge of the door to the centerline of the lock and determine whether it’s 2 ⅜” or 2 ¾”.
<ul>
<li>Note: 2 ⅜” and 2 ¾” are quite close to each other. If it’s hard to determine where the center of the lock is, a straight edge may be useful in making a precise measurement.</li>
