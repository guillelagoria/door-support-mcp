<p>Door State Notifications (DSN) is an optional feature for the Latch R that sends notifications to property managers based on door states. Notification emails can be configured to be sent to property managers when doors are left ajar or opened without a valid credential. This is a great way to improve the security of a building without hiring additional staff. Please note that additional sensors are required for this functionality.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1D6H5VRWMF5Z0ZV7VVWAYKH">Door States:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Door Ajar: </strong>When a door is left ajar, a notification email can be configured to be sent after 30, 60, or 90 seconds.</li>
<li>
<strong>Door Still Ajar: </strong>If the door remains ajar, an email can be configured to be sent every 5, 10, or 15 minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Door Breached: </strong>When a door is opened without a valid credential, a notification email is sent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Door Secure: </strong>When a door is not in the Door Secure state and the door is then closed, a Door Secure notification is sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two additional features that are an advantage of the sensors used for DSN, are automatic unlock and relock. The Latch R can be set to automatically unlock when it detects motion on the secure side of the door, allowing egress without manual intervention like pushing a button. The Latch R can also be set to automatically relock as soon as the door has been opened, preventing additional people from entering through an unopened door.</p>
