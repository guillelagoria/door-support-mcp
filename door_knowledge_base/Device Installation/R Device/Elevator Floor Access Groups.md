<h3 id="h_01J1WZRKW5HM3BX3CGJN3ZH3YA">Overview</h3>
<p>Elevator Floor Access (EFA) is an optional feature your property can install for improved safety and security. It allows users to unlock only the floors they should have access to, preventing unauthorized users from reaching your floor.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1WZRKW5JDTXAJ8WZ95ZS8TX">Viewing Your Floor Access Permissions</h3>
<p>Please note that not all Latch Rs that unlock elevators have Elevator Floor Access. To check if a Latch R has EFA, tap on the respective door in your door List in the DOOR App. This will reveal the door detail page. If there is a menu item called “Floor Information”, this Latch R has EFA, and selecting it will tell you which floors you have access to.</p>
<p>Please note that the floors you can access are set by your property manager.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1WZRKW5F08JYTYEDNEMYNV0">Unlocking Regular Elevators</h3>
<p>The Latch R running EFA is typically installed inside the elevator cab and works just like any other Latch R device, except authenticating allows you to select a destination floor instead of unlocking a door. To unlock the floors of an elevator, unlock the Latch R as you would any other door.</p>
<p>Once the device indicates a successful unlock, you will be able to press the desired floor button, assuming you have access to that floor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the elevator will only respond to the floors that you have been given access to by your property manager. If you cannot access the floors you need, please contact your property manager.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1WZRKW5RVXFVQSD3CABPSB2">Unlocking Elevators with Destination Dispatch</h3>
<p>If you select which floor you go to before you get into the elevator cab, chances are your elevator has what’s called destination dispatch. In this case, there will be a Latch R mounted near the elevator kiosk where you select the floor. You will need to unlock at the kiosk instead of the elevator. To do that, unlock the Latch R as you would any other door. After the device indicates a successful unlock, you will be able to press the desired floor button, assuming you have access to the floor. </p>
<h3 id="h_01J1WZRKW5NPR74J1RJMVWB29B">Sharing Floor Access</h3>
<p>At your property’s discretion, you can share access to elevators like you would share access to your doors. You can share short- or long-term access with people like friends, family, and with services like cleaning and dog walking. The floors you can share are set by your property manager.</p>
<p>If your property manager has allowed you to share access to floors, you can do so through the DOOR App’s “Manage Guests” feature. On the screen “Select doors,” you can view which floors you have permission to share by tapping the “See floors” link beneath the elevator name.</p>
<p>Additionally, if your property manager has set up guest floor access for elevators using Single Day Doorcodes (both 15-minute and 24-hour codes), you can share floor access using Single Day Doorcodes through the DOOR App.</p>
