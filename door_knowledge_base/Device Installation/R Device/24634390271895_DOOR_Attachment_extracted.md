Safety instructions  This product shall be installed and serviced by certified  professionals only.  The product is intended to be used as either a standalone access  control system or as a reader with a panel. Multiple Latch R devices  cannot be used to control a single access point.  Locations and wiring methods shall be in accordance with the  National Electrical Code, ANSI/NFPA 70.  There are no replacement parts available for this product.  Outdoor electrical boxes used for mounting are recommended to  be NEMA 3 or better.  Correct wiring insulation should be used during installation to  prevent the risk of electrical shock.  For UL compliant installations, UL requirements listed in this manual  supersede conflicting information.  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  Testing and Maintenance Operation  •  •   Loose wiring & loose screws.  Normal operation (attempt to unlock with all possible methods).  Prior to installation, ensure that all wiring is secure. Each unit should  be checked annually for:  Impaired Operation  Units are designed to operate under adverse environmental conditions.  Under normal circumstances, they will function properly regardless  of outside conditions. However, units do not have secondary power  sources and cannot function without direct continuous power. If a  unit is damaged by natural causes or deliberate vandalism, it may not  function properly depending on the level of damage.

Electronic Specifications  Latch R offers support for the following credentials:  •  •   Near Field Communication (NFC): ISO 14443A.  NFC Card Type: Mifare Classic.  Bluetooth: BLE 4.2 (iOS and Android compatible).  Maximum BLE distance of 10m.  7 digit passcode.  •  •  •  Configured as a reader, the Latch R can work with Brivo ACS6000,  Keyscan EC1500, Keyscan EC2500 and many other access control  panel systems.  Device requirement for setup  •  •   64 bit iOS device  Latest version of the Latch Manager App  Software Information  •  •   The Latch app is necessary for BLE unlocks and the manager app  is necessary to configure the Latch R.  The device using the Latch app to unlock the product can only be  used in the same manner as a physical credential, transmitting user  data to the reader interface within close proximity.  The device using the Latch app should employ a means of  verification such as a pin or biometric feature to unlock the device  before using the Latch app.  Access logs on the Manager app are able to distinguish the type  of unlock that was done on the device (NFC, Bluetooth, Proximity,  Passcode).  Certification was acquired with Latch app v.2.5.0.  •  •  •

Troubleshooting  •  •   Ensure the lock is powered with DC power. Do not use AC power.  Ensure the input voltage is between 12 and 24 volts DC.  Further troubleshooting information is available on the support  website at   support.latch.com  If lock does not operate:  •  Firmware Version  Latch R has been tested for UL294 compliance employing firmware  version R2.2.1.  The current firmware version can be checked by using the Latch  Manager app.  Further programming information can be found on the support  website at   support.latch.com.  •  •  •  UL 294 Access Control Performance Ratings:  Feature Level Destructive Attack   Level II  Line Security  Endurance  Standby Power  Single Point Locking Device with Key Locks  Level I  Level I  Level I  Level I  Input/Output Options  All inputs/outputs may be configured for normally open or normally  closed contacts. Refer to the wiring diagram for the acceptable wiring  configurations.

Request-to-exit  Request to exit can be setup by configuring the IOs while in use as  a standalone system or configuring the access control system while  configured as a reader with a panel. Please refer to the installation  wiring diagrams for further information.  Normal Product Operation  Condition  Normal Standby  Authenticating User  Access Granted  Access Denied  Keypad Active  Indication  For controlled, protected, and/or restricted areas, access control on  a user basis can be configured with the Latch Manager application.  The keypad activates when a finger is detected and serves as a  touch screen input to enter passcodes for unlocking the device.  Indicator LEDs serve to indicate digits input for a passcode, and  access granted or denied.  •  •  •  All indicator LEDs off, keypad  not illuminated.  Top indicator LED illuminated.  Audible buzzer, all indicator LEDs  illuminate and power down in a  clockwise animation.  Keypad LEDs blink multiple times.  Keypad LEDs illuminated.

Credential Type & Transmission Technology  Credential bit format and length:   Passcodes used to unlock the  device consist of 7 digits ranging from 0-9. NFC cards have 37 bit  format and the wiegand output is 26 bit.  Fail-safe/fail-secure operation:   Fail-safe/fail-secure can be setup  by configuring the relay as either normally closed or normally open.  Normally open allows fail-safe operation while normally closed allows  fail-secure operation.  Configuration & Commissioning Instructions  Configuration & Commissioning instructions can be found in more  detail in the Technical Certification Training as well as on the support  website at   support.latch.com.
