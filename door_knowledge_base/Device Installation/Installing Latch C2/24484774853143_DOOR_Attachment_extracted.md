C2 Installation Guide   Version 2.0 4   5 Things you should know  You must only use hand tools for installation, power tools may damage the product. Although our products are optimized to work with all types of doors, door alignment is extremely important in a deadbolt  install. Doors should be properly specified and hung, and the  strike should be prepped prior to installation. The lens and battery tray should always be paired together. Avoid mixing the exterior and interior assemblies with other locks on the job site. If installing on an active construction site, it is recommended to add painter’s tape around the exterior of the trim where  it meets the door and to leave the protective film on the  device. Do not leave the painter’s tape applied for longer than recommended by the manufacturer.  The product certifications depend on install in accordance  with this guide. More resources, including the electronic version of this guide, can be found online at   support.latch.com.
