<p>It's easy to swap out or deactivate a Latch device without causing disruption. Deactivating removes all access from the device and disassociates it from the door to which it was assigned. Once deactivated, a different door can then be reassigned to the device.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you are a manager and have key access to the door - if you don't, ask your administrator to give you access. You won't be able to deactivate the door unless a key holding it is assigned to your account.</li>
<li>Using the DOOR App, go to the Devices section and select the door from which you want to deactivate the Latch device.</li>
<li>Select 'Deactivate.'</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the door name remains unchanged when programming the new Latch device. This ensures that the right people will still be able to access this door. </li>
</ul>
