<p class="p1">If you are locked out of a non-internet-connected device, the first thing you can try doing is performing a door sync to ensure the device has the latest information. You can find the steps in this article: <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update">How to perform a Door Sync</a></strong></span>.<br><br></p>
<p class="p1">Please note that to assist with these situations, our devices have been designed to unlock using various types of credentials: the DOOR App, a doorcode, a keycard, or a mechanical key (depending on the device). In addition to using one of these alternatives to unlock, we recommend taking these steps:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Reach out to your Property Management directly for immediate assistance accessing your door. They may be able to help you with gaining access to your unit (if they have a key/keycard or through the daily doorcode option below), or perform troubleshooting steps in case the device is not responsive. Please know that for security purposes, DOOR cannot provide you with access to your door directly.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">If you have access to another phone (such as a neighbor's), you can log into your DOOR account from any iOS or Android device that can download the DOOR App. Once you've viewed your codes, you can log out of the DOOR App (just make sure the phone doesn't save your password and that you log out completely by going to the menu on the top right-hand side, then selecting 'Sign Out'). We recommend performing a password reset to ensure your account is logged out from all devices: <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24675561392407-Log-In-Issues-and-Password-Reset"><strong>Password Change and Password Reset</strong></a></span>.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="li1">If borrowing someone else's iOS or Android device is not an option, note that contacting your Property Management team or anyone with resident access to your unit can help as they can provide you with a daily doorcode via email or phone message to an address or phone number of your choice.</li>
