<p>If you've lost your Latch Keycard or you think it might be stolen, we recommend performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://keycard.latch.com">keycard.latch.com</a></span></strong>
</li>
<li>SelectÂ 'Deactivate'</li>
<li>Enter your DOOR email address (that you use to log in to the app)</li>
<li>Check your email and confirm the deactivation</li>
<li>Perform a <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update">Door Sync</a></span></strong> on your device using your DOOR App (or request your property management team perform the door sync) as the keycard will still work on any non-internet-connected doors until a door sync is performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need a new Keycard, contact your property management and activate it with the following steps.</p>
