<p>We’ve designed our devices to unlock using various types of credentials: the DOOR App, a doorcode, a keycard, or a mechanical key (depending on the device) to assist with these situations. In addition to using one of the other ways to unlock, we recommend taking these steps:</p>

<p>If you've locked your phone inside your apartment or the battery is dead and you can't remember your doorcode, here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to your Property Management directly for immediate assistance accessing your door. They may be able to help you with gaining access to your unit (if they have a key/keycard or through the daily doorcode option below). For security purposes, DOOR cannot provide you with access to your door directly.</li>
<li>If you have access to another phone (such as a neighbor's), you can log into your DOOR account from any iOS or Android device that can download the DOOR App. Once you've viewed your codes, you can log out of the DOOR App (just make sure the phone doesn't save your password and that you log out completely by going to the menu on the top right corner of the screen and then selecting 'Sign Out'). You can perform a password reset via computer, but cannot log in to the DOOR App from a computer (<strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24675561392407-Log-In-Issues-and-Password-Reset">Password Change and Password Reset</a></span></strong>).</li>
<li>If borrowing someone else's iOS or Android device is not an option, your Property Management (or anyone who has resident access to your unit) can provide you with a daily doorcode via email if you are able to access your email. Similar to before, please be sure to log out of your e-mail and ensure your password is not saved on another user's phone if you borrow one.<br> </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, we recommend performing a <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24109913875991-Changing-or-Resetting-Your-Password">password reset</a></span></strong> using the steps in this article. This will automatically log your account out of any other devices it's logged in to. If this is not feasible, you may ask your property management to temporarily remove your building access to protect the security of your apartment (you'll want to perform a <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update">Door Sync</a></span></strong> using the DOOR App after revoking your access to remove it from the door). </p>
