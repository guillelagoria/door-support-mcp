<p>Once your Latch device has been installed and your account has been created through the management platform, DoorOS, you’re all set to begin using your Door App and Latch Device.</p>
<p>If this is your first time receiving Door access, you’ll receive a Door invitation e-mail to guide you through creating your password and finishing setting up your Door account (otherwise, you’ll see the doors added directly to your existing Door account).</p>
<h2 id="h_01J226F7Q9V2TJRESDAHE32D0W">Downloading the Door App</h2>
<p>When you’ve created your password, download it, then open the Door App (<strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/door/id6499252863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, </span><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.door.doorapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">) and log in using your new password. You'll want to ensure your Bluetooth and Location services are toggled 'On' and that you've enabled permissions for the Door App to access both. </span></p>
