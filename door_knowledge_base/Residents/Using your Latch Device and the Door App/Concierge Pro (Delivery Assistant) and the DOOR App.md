<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://www.latch.com/latch-concierge-pro">Concierge Pro</a></span></strong> (formerly Delivery Assistant) provides properties with a 24/7 personalized, virtual doorman and access solutions for deliveries. Concierge Pro facilitates access for your trusted delivery personnel and alerts you via text or phone notification when you have a package waiting. <br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01J21TBCT4F4WD6N79V1JS06A2">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Concierge Pro connects your Latch Intercom and associated door with trained service representatives. Upon arriving at your property, the package courier will use your Latch Intercom to contact our Virtual Doorman, who will verify the caller's identity. If approved, our Virtual Doorman grants the caller access and, if a Latch Camera is installed, monitors the package drop off in the package room. Once your delivery is complete, DOOR sends you a notification so you can retrieve the package at your convenience. We use a highly-trained security operations firm with over a decade of experience to monitor your building.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01J21TBCT45EF8SW5ZJKDRFE1E">I'm not getting text notifications for package deliveries or need to change the phone number used for my notifications.</h2>
<p>Please verify the phone number associated with your DOOR account. For additional help, or if you need to update your phone number, contact your Property Manager.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01J21TBCT4418ZWNTB7TAKATMN">Can I get notifications to more than one phone number?</h2>
<p>Notifications are sent to the phone associated with your DOOR account. At this time, only one phone number can be associated with a DOOR account.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01J21TBCT4X4QP3PX7M3CH56RH">I can’t open the package room - what can I do?</h2>
<p>If you're not able to perform an unlock at the package room door with the DOOR App, your doorcode, or a DOOR Keycard (if you have one), we recommend reaching out to your property management team for assistance.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01J21TBCT4X58PK9V3VHSAS1EJ">I received a delivery notification, but when I checked the package room there was no package - what can I do?</h2>
<p>If you received a notification and did not have a package waiting for you, please verify the tracking and shipping information from your courier to confirm that the details match your delivery notification date. If you cannot locate your package, please reach out to your Property Manager to see if they have additional information. If you’re still unable to locate your package, consider filing a claim with the courier responsible for delivering your package.</p>
