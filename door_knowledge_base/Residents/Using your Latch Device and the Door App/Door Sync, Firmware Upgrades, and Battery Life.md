<p>The Door App allows you to perform certain functions to help optimize the performance of your Latch device or specific features. To view details about and ensure the best performance of your Latch device, navigate to Access, select your door, and then tap the door name. From there, you'll see the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Access time</strong>: This will show you the start and end date/time of your access to the door. </li>
<li>
<strong>Device details</strong>: This section will share your device Model, Firmware Version, and Battery Level. The best way to ensure your battery reading is up to date is to perform a manual sync. </li>
<li>
<strong>Sync</strong>: To perform a manual door sync on your device, select 'Sync,' then tap the blue 'Sync' button. Note that the date/time of the Last Sync may reflect a passive sync (instead of a complete manual sync); to ensure your history and battery readings are current, we recommend performing a manual sync from time to time. </li>
<li>
<strong>Upgrade firmware</strong>: This section will show the firmware version on your device. If you need to perform a firmware upgrade (only available in locks with Geneva Lens for residents), you'll be able to perform a firmware upgrade here.</li>
<li>
<strong>History</strong>: This section will show the available History for this door.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01J21YGY8YVGN2H4CV41ZEQH58">What are Door Syncs?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update">Door Syncs</a></strong></span> pull the most recent information available from a Latch device (such as access logs and battery percentage) and push any relevant syncs to the device (such as access credentials that have been added or revoked from the device via the Door App or Door Web). Therefore, doors without an internet connection require a sync:<br></span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Any time access to the device is revoked.</li>
<li class="p1">When a user with access to the door activates a keycard.</li>
<li class="p1">If a user is granted Door App access to the door, but plans to use their doorcode (and does not intend to use the Door App first).</li>
<li class="p1">If you would like to see the most recent activity logs from the device in the Door App or Door Web.</li>
<li class="p1">If you would like to see the most up-to-date battery reading in the Door App or Door Web.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01H41BQEF9HYGZR8J0CVBXNNX0">What are Firmware Upgrades?</h2>
<div>Firmware Upgrades improve device performance, add functionality, and enhance security.</div>
<div>How Upgrades Work by Device:</div>
<ul>
<li>Readers (R2) with version ≥ 5.0.4 and internet connection
<ul>
<li>Receive automatic firmware upgrades in the background.</li>
<li>If it's not internet-connected or it's running an older version, a manual upgrade is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>G Devices
<ul>
<li>Support manual upgrades through the Door App.</li>
<li>If a new firmware is available, each unlock via the DOOR App will attempt to upgrade the firmware. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>How to Upgrade Firmware Manually:</div>
<ol>
<li>Go to Access → select the desired door</li>
<li>Look for 'Upgrade firmware' and tap it</li>
<li>If an upgrade is available, tap to begin.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01J21YGY8YD1EMXJ6D87PBRQ3K">Will I receive an alert about a low battery? </h2>
<p>While you won't receive an alert about low battery, as noted above, a small message next to Device Details indicates the battery is below 15%. If you manage your own Latch device, you'll want to change the batteries or if you do not manage your Latch device, we recommend contacting your property management team to request that they change the batteries (see the<strong> <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24477768681239-Changing-Batteries-and-Battery-Management">Changing Batteries article</a></span></strong> for steps).</p>
