<p>With DOOR, there are multiple ways to unlock your doors, giving you the ability to use the one that works best for you.*</p>
<h3 id="h_01H9K2CDSMC6220Q7VEKS5TSJG"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">DOOR App Unlock via Bluetooth</span></strong></h3>
<h3 id="h_01H9K2CDSM185ZEF6ZZDYQB50Y">Hold Near to Unlock</h3>
<p>For both iOS and Android users, the DOOR App will perform an unlock via Bluetooth near any door you have access to and have the DOOR App open. To initiate an unlock, simply open the DOOR App, hold the phone close to the black Latch Lens on the device, and the DOOR App will automatically find and unlock the right Door. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">There are additional Hold Near to Unlock settings available for Android users:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can turn off Hold Near to Unlock by navigating to 'Access', selecting 'Settings', and toggling off the Hold Near to Unlock slider.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01H9K2CDSN4HFXY5M02ZYPTT9Q">Tap to Unlock</h3>
<p>You may also initiate a Bluetooth unlock in the DOOR App via the 'Unlock' button. To do so, open your DOOR App, look for the door in the Access widget, and tap the 'Unlock' button next to your Door's name. </p>
<h3 id="h_01H9K2CDSNX7HX9KC66CKFKXPE"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Doorcode </span></strong></h3>
<p>When property managers enable doorcodes for a specific door, users who have access to that door receive a doorcode they can use as another unlock method. Doorcodes are unique and created directly by DOOR, and no two users at a single property will ever be granted the same doorcode for a given door or set of communal doors. As you are the only one who is given a specific doorcode, it's important not to share the doorcodes in your DOOR App (see the section on inviting guests for additional information on sharing access).</p>
<p>Note: Changing communal doors' doorcodes requires manager assistance. For security purposes, we do not recommend sharing your personal doorcodes. To provide guest access, please use the steps in this article on letting a guest in.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Where can I find my doorcodes?</span></p>
<p>To view your doorcodes, you'll need to be logged in to the DOOR App. Once logged in, go to 'Access', and tap on the 'Doorcodes' button to reveal your Doors' doorcodes. You can also see your doorcodes individually within each door. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Performing a doorcode unlock</span></p>
<p>While at the Latch device, to enter a doorcode, simply tap the lens of the device to illuminate the LEDS and using the pad of your finger, enter your doorcode.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter each subsequent digit within five seconds. The Latch device will timeout and erase your entry if you do not enter a digit after five seconds. This is to ensure that if you get one wrong, you can try again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap the digit with the pad of your finger to ensure the Latch Lens registers your finger. Ensure one of the circular status LEDs light up every time you input a digit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a status LED does not light up after you input a digit, it means your finger was not detected. After entering all seven digits, the circular status LEDs should make a full circle to indicate the unlock is successful. If the Lens flashes twice, you may have entered the doorcode incorrectly, or the device may not be synced (for steps on how to sync your door, please see <a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>this article</strong></span></a>). If the lens' LED's turns off, please attempt your doorcode again as the lens has likely timed out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of doorcodes, Residence Doorcodes and Communal Doorcodes.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Residence Doorcodes</span></p>
<p>For doors that are set up as a "residence" by managers, DOOR App users are provided a single doorcode specific to that door (and unique to each user). This 7-digit doorcode is randomly generated to ensure security. Once the door has been unlocked by the resident via the DOOR App (or a manual door sync has been performed), the doorcode will work until the user has been removed and the door has been <a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>synced</strong></span></a>. </p>
<p>You can reset these doorcodes with the button 'Reset Doorcodes' within your door.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Communal Doorcodes</span></p>
<p>For doors that are set up as building entrances, communal, or service doors, DOOR App users will receive a single unique doorcode for these doors. That said, no two users at the same property will ever be assigned the same communal doorcode. Doors that are connected, such as wifi or Ethernet-connected Latch R's, will automatically have the doorcode updated and should work within a few minutes of the user being added. If communal doors are not internet-connected, a Door <a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Sync</strong></span></a> is necessary to update your doorcodes to that door. </p>
<p>To reset your communal doorcodes, you will need to reach out to your property management team or host and ask them to revoke<strong> all</strong> of your current access and then re-grant it, as this will generate new Doorcode(s) for your account.</p>
<p>Please note that to ensure that the prior Doorcode(s) is no longer valid on any non-internet connected Latch devices (such as the one on an apartment unit door), a door sync must be performed once you are re-invited to access your doors with the DOOR App to remove the old doorcode from your door.</p>

<h2 id="01JJQDTRVQTJR6PFD84Q771TF8">Latch Keycard</h2>
<p>Latch Keycard is a physical credential to work across any door in any building you have access. It leverages a secure process -- similar to setting up a credit card and is easy to set up and use.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Activating a Latch Keycard</span></p>
<p>If your property management team has not activated your Latch keycard, or you have door access across multiple properties (or have both Guest and Resident access to the same property), you can activate the keycard by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://keycard.latch.com">keycard.latch.com</a></span></strong>
</li>
<li>Select 'Activate'</li>
<li>Enter the serial number printed on the Keycard</li>
<li>Enter your DOOR email (that you login into the app with)</li>
<li>Open your email and press 'activate'</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to add Keycard to your doors.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Performing an Unlock with a Latch Keycard</span></p>
<p>Tap the Latch device lens to wake the device and present your Keycard.</p>
<p><u>Deactivating a Latch Keycard</u></p>
<p>You can easily deactivate your keycard if it's lost, stolen, or you no longer need it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://keycard.latch.com">keycard.latch.com</a></span></strong>
</li>
<li>Select 'Deactivate'</li>
<li>Enter your DOOR email address (that you use to log in to the app)</li>
<li>Check your email and confirm the deactivation</li>
<li>Your property management will be informed to sync your device to ensure the Keycard no longer works, but you can also sync your device using the DOOR App.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">How do I get a Latch Keycard?</span></p>
<p>Contact your property manager for your building's policy on Keycard.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Can I have more than one Keycard?</span></p>
<p>You can only have one active keycard at any one time. </p>
<h2 id="h_01H9K2CDSN4V0Q67GNKFV8A7MC">Mechanical Key</h2>
<p>Certain devices are compatible with mechanical keys. If you don't manage your own Latch device, please check with your property management team for additional questions on mechanical keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.door.com/hc/article_attachments/24677379354007" alt="Ways"></p>
<h2 id="h_01H9K2CDSNTP038V42395WNMSQ">Android Users: Near Field Communication (NFC) Unlock</h2>
<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a specialized protocol for objects to communicate with one another. It works within a few inches, making it a particularly reliable and fast way to unlock Latch locks. It is also the protocol used for things like Latch Keycard, Apple and Google Pay, and everyday key fobs.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">How do I enable NFC unlock for my Android phone?</span></p>
<p>If you are using the latest version of the DOOR App for Android, NFC is automatically turned on. Please note, your phone will only use NFC if the lock you're trying to unlock is running the latest firmware version. If the lock does not have a supported firmware version, the Android DOOR App will default to Bluetooth unlock.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Why is NFC available on Android but not iOS?</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Apple does not currently allow NFC to be used to unlock doors. We’re continuing to work hard to make this feature available for DOOR iOS users.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Can I turn off NFC?</span></p>
<p>You can turn off NFC under Access &gt; Settings. Once off, your DOOR App will use Bluetooth to unlock your door.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">What is unlock from background?</span></p>
<p>Using NFC, you may be able to unlock your door without unlocking your phone or opening the DOOR App. To do so, you must have the latest version of the DOOR App for Android, and your Latch devices must be running a specific firmware version. You can opt in to unlock from the background in Access &gt; Settings.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">What if my phone gets lost or stolen and unlock from background is enabled?</span></p>
<p>Depending on your device and the version of the Android operating system, you may be able to remotely wipe and restore your Android phone. Please check with your device manufacturer and Google’s Android support.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H9K2CDSN079D18R1QJ5HVW4Z">iOS Users: iOS Widget</h2>
<p>DOOR has two different iOS widgets available: the Lock Screen and Access widget. Each widget is designed to allow users to utilize their preferred DOOR services and experiences with ease. For information on how to set up widgets, please see <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122" target="_self">this article</a></strong></span> from Apple.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Access Widget</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The Access widget comes in three different sizes (small, medium, and large) and allows you to place a widget on your home screen with your preferred doors. Once the Access Widget is set up, selecting a door will open the DOOR App and initiate an unlock. With the Home Screen Access Widget, you are able to unlock your doors more quickly and set up pathways of your preferred doors that you utilize on a regular basis. The medium widget allows you to have up to four doors selected, and the large widget allows you to have up to ten doors. You can configure which devices are in the widget by navigating to your DOOR App, selecting the 'Access' tile, and tapping on the 'Widget' icon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Lock Screen Widget</span></p>
<p>The Lock Screen widget allows iOS users to place a widget on their customized lock screen. For information on how to add a Lock Screen widget please see <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/personalize-your-iphone-lock-screen-iph4d0e6c351/ios" target="_self">this article</a></strong></span> from Apple.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.door.com/hc/article_attachments/34044434386967" width="240" height="486"></p>
<p>The Lock Screen widget allows you to press the widget and open the DOOR App directly from your lock screen. You will need to ensure your phone is unlocked with FaceID or your personal PIN in order to navigate. While an unlock does not initiate immediately upon the app opening, you can proceed to use Hold Near to Unlock to immediately start unlocking your doors.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p><em>* Whether certain unlock options, such as doorcodes, mechanical keys, and keycards, are available depends on policies put in place at the property level. For questions about the availability of these unlock options at your property, please contact your property management. If you are managing your own Latch device and have questions about these options, please reach out to DOOR Support at <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="mailto:support@door.com">support@door.com</a></strong></span>.</em></p>
