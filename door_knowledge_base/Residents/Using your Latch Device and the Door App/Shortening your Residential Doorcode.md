<p>If your building has eligible devices, and your property manager has updated the preferred doorcode length for your property, you may opt for a shorter doorcode for your private unit door.</p>
<p>Once you<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> receive an email confirming that the doorcode length has been changed for the unit doors at your property, follow the steps below to reset your doorcode to a shorter, easier-to-remember code. </span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JMJ4FJWRH4ZNA4RSE2CR0GMV">To reset your doorcode to a shorter length:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the Access tab in the DOOR App.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select your unit door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Device Details to ensure you’re running on Firmware Version 2.0.7 or later. If not, select Upgrade Firmware on the door page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap 'Reset Doorcode' to receive your new, shorter code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform a <a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Sync">Door Sync</a> (while within Bluetooth range of your door) to activate your new code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="h_01JMJ4FJWRV4BQQA1WCGQE4YW3">Once synced, you’ll be able to use your new doorcode right away!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Note</strong>: If you previously had a <em>shorter</em> code and your property manager selects a longer length as the default for your building, your doorcode will be automatically updated to the new length.</span></p>
