<p>DOOR sends emails to you to let you know about important items such as creating a DOOR account, new access given to you, reset password links, and more. If you are not receiving these emails, it may be for one of the following reasons:</p>
<h2 id="h_01J21RBF7JE7BH1Y1FN6ZH4473">1. Your inbox may be full or needs to be refreshed</h2>
<p>We recommend deleting a few emails to ensure you have space to receive new ones. Once complete, you'll want to refresh your email inbox.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J21RBF7JT6KAH89646603NH3">2. You are using a company email with a Firewall </h2>
<p>If you have a company email, there could be a firewall that has been set up by your company's IT department to block out third-party emails. We recommend contacting your company's IT department to whitelist <a href="mailto:no-reply@door.com"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>no-reply@door.com</strong></span></a>. Alternatively, ask your property manager or host to use your personal email address instead to give you access.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J21RBF7JTRP8ANBV5BDJM78N">3. DOOR emails are going to your spam folder</h2>
<p>Your email client may be accidentally sending DOOR emails to the spam folder. Check your spam folder and check your email provider's instructions on how to prevent email addresses from going to the spam folder. We recommend adding <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="mailto:no-reply@door.com">no-reply@door.com</a></strong></span><a href="mailto:no-reply@latch.com"> </a>to your safe sender's list/email contact list and attempting a password reset.</p>
