<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When attempting to log in or reset your password, if you see an error message reading ‘Email does not match any enterprise directory, it’s likely you’ve accidentally selected ‘Sign in via SSO' (Single Sign On). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To log in, press ‘Cancel’ and return to the sign-in screen. From there, you may either input your DOOR Account e-mail address and password and select ‘Sign In’ or choose ‘Forgot Password’ to initiate a password reset.</span></p>
