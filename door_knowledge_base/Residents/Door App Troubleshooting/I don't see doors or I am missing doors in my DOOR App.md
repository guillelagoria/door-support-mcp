<p>If you do not see your doors listed in the Access section of the DOOR App, we recommend verifying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are signing into the DOOR App using the correct email address that is associated with your DOOR account. For users with multiple email addresses, please ensure the email address you received the initial DOOR invitation with is the email address being used to sign in.</li>
<li>Your access start date has begun. For users who have recently been provided with DOOR App access, please ensure that the Start Time set up by your property management team or host has begun. Once your access time begins, you will see each door you have access to appear in the DOOR App.</li>
<li>If you have verified the above steps and still don't see any doors listed, your access may have expired. In such cases, we recommend reaching out to your property management team or host for them to verify you have current access, as DOOR does not create or make changes to user access. </li>
</ul>
<p>For further questions, please reach out to your property manager. </p>
