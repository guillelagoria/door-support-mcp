<p>If the numbers on the lens blink after typing in your doorcode or attempting to use a Latch Keycard, it's possible the doorcode was incorrectly entered or, in both cases, your access may not be synced to the Latch device. We recommend the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify in your DOOR App that you have current access to the door you're attempting to unlock.</li>
<li>If you do have current access, perform a <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Update">manual sync</a></span></strong> using the DOOR App.</li>
<li>Attempt a DOOR App unlock by tapping the blue 'Unlock' button.</li>
<li>Attempt an unlock using your doorcode and/or Latch Keycard again. Ensure you're tapping the device lens to wake the device before typing in your doorcode or presenting your Latch Keycard, and that you're following the doorcode recommendations in this article. </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If these steps do not fix the issue, we recommend you contact your property management team for assistance</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.
