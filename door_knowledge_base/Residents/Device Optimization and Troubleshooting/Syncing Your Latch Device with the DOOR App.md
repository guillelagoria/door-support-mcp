<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Performing a sync on your Latch device is critical to ensuring optimal functionality and that the device receives any changes you've made, particularly as it relates to access. Any user with DOOR App access to a door may perform a door sync.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Doors without an internet connection require a sync whenever you:<br></span></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Revoke someone's access</li>
<li class="p1">Activate a Keycard </li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: Doors are automatically synced whenever someone unlocks a door for the first time with the app (during the “setting up” process). You may also intervene and sync the doors yourself with the DOOR App (e.g., if the user plans to use a doorcode or Keycard to interact with their door and is unable to use the DOOR App).</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HGJVMYMST8NRK7DG982CSNFR">How to sync a door using the DOOR App</h2>
<p>In the DOOR App (while physically at the Latch device):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Access section in your DOOR App</li>
<li>Select the door you'd like to sync and tap on the sync button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sync should only take a few moments. During this time, please do not step away from the device or close your app. Once your Door is synced, a green check mark will appear, along with the date and time of the last sync.</p>
