<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can see "</span><strong>Controls"</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the Devices section, but one or more of your smart devices is not displayed, please contact your Property Manager for further assistance. They will work with the DOOR Customer Support team to investigate the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you cannot see the DOOR Smart home devices in the Devices section</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the DOOR App, we first recommend running through the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm you're signed in to the <span style="font-weight: 400;">DOOR</span> App using the correct e-mail address. Signing in with the wrong account may cause confusion as the required permissions/access may not be assigned to that account.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Log out of the DOOR App and then log back in to refresh the App. To do this:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the Profile menu (on the top right-hand side of the DOOR App).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select 'Sign Out.' </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then sign back in with your correct email address and password.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not see <span style="font-weight: 400;">the DOOR Smart home devices in the Devices section</span> after completing these steps, please contact your property manager. They can verify that you are correctly listed as a resident for your unit and assist with further troubleshooting.</p>
