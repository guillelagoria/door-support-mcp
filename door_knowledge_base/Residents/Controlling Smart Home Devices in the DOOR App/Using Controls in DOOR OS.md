<p>As a manager, you can use <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com">DOOR OS</a></strong></span> to manage your DOOR Smart Home devices, including setting up and configuring alerts and notifications, renaming your devices, seeing your device's history, and deleting/deactivating them from the property. <em>Note that, in order to activate a device, you will need to use the DOOR App</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JNPG5EWZEDK0B5BFSMHZBP8T">Managing your DOOR Smart Home device (setting up alerts, renaming the device)</h3>
<p>Follow the steps below to manage your activated DOOR Smart Home device. Note that the type of configurations you can change on the device will vary depending on the type of device you're managing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com">DOOR OS</a></strong></span> with an account with management permissions.</li>
<li>After making sure you're located in the correct portfolio/property, navigate to the 'Controls' section by clicking on the 'Controls' button in the navigation bar.</li>
<li>If you have activated the DOOR Smart Hoome device in the building (without adding it to a specific unit), you should see a tile with the device's name and current connectivity status below the dropdown section 'Building'. If you have activated the device inside a unit instead, you'll need to locate the unit and click on it to see the device's tile.</li>
<li>Click on the device's tile.</li>
<li>In the resulting screen, navigate to the 'Settings' sub-tab and locate the menu you'd like to modify.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01JNPGQNX32MXSDD9W47B9NEHW">Seeing your device's history</h3>
<p>Following the steps above, navigate to the 'History' sub-tab on a specific device. Once there, you'll be able to see the history entries from your DOOR Smart Home's sensor capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JNPHR8X75R3CKSD5W10PSSYZ">Deleting/deactivating your DOOR Smart Home device</h3>
<p>You'll be able to delete DOOR Smart Home devices from the property directly in <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com">DOOR OS</a></strong></span>. To delete the device:</p>
