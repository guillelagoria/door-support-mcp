Below is a breakdown of the key sections you’ll find on your Home screen and what each one allows you to do.</p><p data-start="408" data-end="430"><strong data-start="408" data-end="430">Building Selection</strong></p><p data-start="432" data-end="692">At the top of your Home screen, you'll see the name of your current building. If you have access to more than one property, you can tap the building name to switch between them. This allows you to manage access and devices across multiple locations in one app.</p><p data-start="694" data-end="704"><strong data-start="694" data-end="704">Access</strong></p><p data-start="706" data-end="933">The Access section displays the doors assigned to your account, such as your lobby, front door, or garage. Each door shows its name and an "Unlock" button. Tapping this button allows you to unlock the door via Bluetooth.</p><p data-start="935" data-end="1085">Note the DOOR App also supports <strong>proximity-based unlocking (Hold Near to Unlock), </strong>which allows you to unlock a door simply by opening your DOOR App and placing your phone next to the device. If you are an Android user, you can enable or disable the Hold Near to Unlock feature by going into 'Access', tapping on the cogwheel right above the door list, and toggling on/off the 'Hold Near to Unlock' option. If you are an iOS user, the Hold Near to Unlock feature is active by default and cannot be deactivated.</p><p data-start="935" data-end="1085">New Features in Access:</p><ul>
