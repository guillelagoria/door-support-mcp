<p data-start="182" data-end="441"><strong data-start="182" data-end="220">Welcome to DOOR — A Building Intelligence Platform</strong><br>We’re upgrading your experience. The DOOR App replaces the Latch App, offering a more intuitive design, better performance, and new features that put you in control. Here’s everything you need to know about the switch.</p><p data-start="443" data-end="738"><strong data-start="443" data-end="468">What is the DOOR App?</strong><br>The DOOR App is the new way to access your building—and more. Built on the foundation of Latch technology, it offers improved navigation, new features like smart home device control and service scheduling, and a seamless, secure experience designed for modern living.</p><p data-start="740" data-end="1047"><strong data-start="740" data-end="784">Why are we switching from Latch to DOOR?</strong><br>This transition is about moving forward. DOOR represents a smarter, sleeker, more integrated future—one where building access, automation, and support work in sync. You still get the same reliable access, now with a better app experience and expanded features.</p><p data-start="1049" data-end="1080"><strong data-start="1049" data-end="1078">How do I make the switch?</strong></p><ol data-start="1081" data-end="1219">
<li data-start="1081" data-end="1144"><p data-start="1084" data-end="1108">Download the DOOR App for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/door/id6499252863">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.door.doorapp&amp;pli=1">Android</a></p></li>
<li data-start="1081" data-end="1144"><p data-start="1084" data-end="1108">Log in using your existing Latch credentials</p></li>
<li data-start="1081" data-end="1144"><p data-start="1084" data-end="1108">Delete the Latch App</p></li>
</ol><p data-start="1221" data-end="1442"><strong data-start="1221" data-end="1266">When will I lose access to the Latch App?</strong><br>You’ll retain access to Latch during the transition, but we recommend deleting the Latch App after installing DOOR. Eventually, all functionality will shift to DOOR.</p><p data-start="1444" data-end="1601"><strong data-start="1444" data-end="1476">Will I need new credentials?</strong><br>No. Your current login details carry over. If you forget your password, tap “Forgot Password” in the DOOR App to reset it.</p><p data-start="1603" data-end="1883"><strong data-start="1603" data-end="1638">Do I need training to use DOOR?</strong><br>No training needed. The app is designed to feel familiar, with smarter navigation and helpful in-app guidance. However, if you would like to explore features in more depth, please visit our <a href="support.door.com" data-start="1808" data-end="1827" rel="noopener"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Knowledge Base</span></strong></a> or contact <a data-start="1839" data-end="1882" rel="noopener">support@door.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Are there any Latch products or functionality that will not be supported in the DOOR App/DOOR OS?</strong></p><p>Currently, only DOOR smart home devices are supported in the DOOR App. Residents or managers with smart home devices previously supported by Latch (Honeywell, Nest, Ecobee), etc. may either switch to those products' app to manage their devices or continue using Latch Mission Control and the Latch App until we provide further instructions. We also note this initial version of DOOR OS will not include/support bookings - properties may continue to use Latch Mission Control and the Latch App until DOOR OS supports those features.</p><p data-start="1885" data-end="2092"><strong data-start="1885" data-end="1922">Who can I contact with questions?</strong><br>For help logging in, using features, or reporting issues, contact our support team or your building management directly. We’re here to help make the transition smooth.</p>
