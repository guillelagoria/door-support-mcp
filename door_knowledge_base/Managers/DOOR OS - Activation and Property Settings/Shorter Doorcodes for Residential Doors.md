<h3 id="h_01JP2N9BEBGYQDV7A1R48B0549">What are Short Doorcodes?</h3>
<p>In <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></strong></span>, Property Managers can now change the default doorcode length for residential doors at their building. </p>
<p>Residents can then choose when or if they'd like to reset their code to a shorter-length doorcode. Note that your residents' doorcodes will be automatically regenerated if their codes were <em>shorter</em> than the new target doorcode length before the change.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JP2NB873W3H1GWAHVRXNADGR">Where can I set up Shorter Doorcodes?</h3>
<p>To set up Short Doorcodes at your property, you need at least one G-Lens lock running on firmware version G 2.0.7 or higher and paired to a residential door:</p>
<p>- Residence door type: Short Doorcodes cannot be set up for Communal doors at the moment.</p>
<p>- G-Lens Lock: Short Doorcodes will only work on G-Lens locks. If you don't know the type of lock you have at your property, you can review this information in DOOR OS &gt; Reports &gt; Access Devices, under the column 'Product Type' </p>
<p>- Firmware version G 2.0.7 or higher: Short Doorcodes will only work on locks running on FW version G 2.0.7 or higher. If you don't know the firmware version of your locks that are currently running on your property, you can review this information in DOOR OS &gt; Reports &gt; Access Devices, under the column 'Firmware Version'</p>
<h3 id="h_01JMJ6Y8JGTWG7HV1J40DSHGNH">How can I change the length of my Doorcodes' in my property?</h3>
<p>To change your property's doorcode length, you need to:</p>
<p>- Log into DOOR OS with an account with management permissions.</p>
<p>- Navigate to the Manage Settings on the left-hand side, and select 'Access Settings'.</p>
<p>- Choose 'Doorcode Length'</p>
<p>- If there's at least one G-Lens device paired to a residence door in your property, you'll see the option to 'Change Doorcode Length', and you will be able to select between lengths of 4 - 7 digits for your property's doorcodes.</p>
<p>- Save your changes to apply them. From there, residents can select 'Reset Doorcode' to opt for the shorter code. Note that they'll need to perform a door sync after resetting their code for the new codes to work and the previous code to be replaced. </p>
