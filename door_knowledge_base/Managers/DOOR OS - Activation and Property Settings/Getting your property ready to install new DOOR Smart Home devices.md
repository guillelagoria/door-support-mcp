<p><strong>Before You Begin</strong></p>
<p>To install DOOR Smart Home devices at your property, you’ll need to ensure a few foundational pieces are in place. This guide walks you through everything required, so install is a breeze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p id="h_01JYM1KNEFAVY5BDW2E1Q0720Q"><strong>Step 1: Ensure you have the right hardware </strong></p>
<p>Before you begin installation, take time to review the specifications and installation guides for each DOOR Smart Home device (see articles at the bottom of this guide). Confirm that you have any required accessories or supporting components, such as compatible light bulbs or mounting materials.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Installing devices without the proper hardware can lead to incomplete setups or unnecessary delays. Preparing ahead ensures a smooth, efficient installation.</p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirm Management Permissions</strong><br>To prepare for and activate Smart Home devices, you’ll need the right permissions. Only Portfolio Managers can grant these permissions.</p>
<p><br>- For Pre-Installation steps (creating units, assigning residents to units), you’ll need Full Key Management Permissions.</p>
<p><br>- For Device Installation, you’ll need Device Management Permissions.</p>
<p><em>Tip: If you're not sure whether or not you have the right access, reach out to your Portfolio Manager to confirm or request management permissions.</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create Units</strong><br>Units represent spaces and connect residents and DOOR Smart Home devices. Whether or not you’re ready to onboard residents, Units must be created to activate and assign devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To add a Unit to your property:</p>
<p>1. Log into DOOR OS with your account's credentials.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the Access section and select 'Units' in the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>3. Click on the 'Add Unit' button on the top right corner of the section.</p>
<p>4. Create all of the units you need for your residential doors. You can do this manually one unit at a time or via CSV file upload.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 (Optional): Assign Residents to Units</strong><br>Now that your Units are live, it’s time to link them to the right people. You can do this prior to installation or after, but this step is required for your residents to control their newly activated Smart Home devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To assign a unit to a Resident's account:</p>
<p>1. Log into DOOR OS with your account's credentials.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the 'People' section.</p>
<p>3. Look for the account you'll be editing (or, if the user has not been onboarded into your property yet, invite them).</p>
<p>4. If the user exists in your property, locate their profile, click on it and then on 'Edit' on the top right section of their profile.</p>
<p>5. Add the created Unit to their account.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Install DOOR Smart Home Devices</strong><br>With Units and residents set up, you’re ready to activate your devices using the DOOR App. Note that <strong>Device Management permissions are required</strong> to install hardware. Be sure your account has these enabled.</p>
<p><br><em>Important: Scanning the QR code on each smart home device is required for activation – be sure not to install smart devices (e.g. light switches) without capturing or scanning the QR code first to ensure</em> <em>installation goes smoothly.</em></p>
<p><br>1. Log into the DOOR App with an account that has management permissions.</p>
<p>2. Select the property where you want to install the device.</p>
<p>3. Open Controls.</p>
<p>4. Tap Devices from the bottom nav.</p>
<p>5. Tap Add a Device, or go into the Controls tab and choose a Unit.</p>
<p>6. Scan the device's QR code. If you can’t scan, tap “I can’t scan the device” and enter the serial number.</p>
<p>7. Follow the in-app instructions to complete installation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>If you don’t assign the device to a specific Unit, it will be added at the building level—and won’t show up in your resident’s Controls tab.<br></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You're All Set</strong></p>
<p>You’ve now unlocked the foundation of Building Intelligence at your property. With Units, permissions, and smart hardware in place, you’re ready to offer a smarter, simpler living experience for every resident.</p>
