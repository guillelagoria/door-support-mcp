<p>In order to ensure residents’ privacy at their apartment doors, <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></span></strong> allows property managers to assign resident status to a key holder when adding a key to their account. For any key that a user is not a resident, the DOOR system will designate them as a non-resident. We also note that regardless of resident status, activity by accounts with property management permissions will be visible at all residence doors.</p>
<p>If a user is designated non-resident for a key, their logs on private doors contained within that key will be visible in DOOR OS &gt; History. This designation has no impact on public/communal doors, which default to making logs visible. To comply with DOOR's <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://door.com/pages/terms-of-service?_pos=1&amp;_sid=94a44e5b7&amp;_ss=r">Terms of Service</a></span></strong> and <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://door.com/pages/privacy-notice?_pos=1&amp;_sid=11dcf26b9&amp;_ss=r">Privacy Policy</a></span></strong>, and any applicable laws and regulations, please ensure that all of your residents are assigned accordingly for their residence/private doors.</p>
