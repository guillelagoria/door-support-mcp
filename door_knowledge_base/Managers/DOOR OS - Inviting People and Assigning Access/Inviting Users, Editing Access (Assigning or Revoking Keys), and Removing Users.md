<p>If you are a manager, whether it's adding or removing a resident or editing the doors they have access to, managing access for your building is simple, fast, and secure with DOOR. To grant, revoke, or edit access, you'll need Key Management permissions. If you don't have the necessary permissions, contact a Portfolio Manager and request that they add Key Management permissions to your account. </p>

<p>Follow the steps below to add someone to your property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your account in the <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></span></strong>
</li>
<li>Select the relevant property.</li>
<li>Select 'People.'</li>
<li>Select 'Invite.'</li>
<li>Decide whether you want to give them the DOOR App or a daily doorcode.</li>
<li>Fill out their contact details.</li>
<li>Add the Keys they need. (<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24273404923287-Creating-Keys">Learn more about making Keys</a></strong></span>).</li>
<li>Select whether this user is a Resident and whether they should have the ability to share the key (see this article on <a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24445776537495-Restricting-Key-Sharing-and-Disabling-Doorcodes"><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Restricting features: May Share Key and Doorcodes for additional details</strong></span></a>).</li>
<li>Select a start time (if you select a future start date, the person will still receive their welcome email today so they can get acquainted with the DOOR App).</li>
<li>We recommend you select an expiration date for the person's access. This ensures that their access is automatically removed on the correct day, such as when their lease expires.</li>
<li>At this point, the recipient will receive a welcome email with their app login details.</li>
<li>Review the door sync tasks on the day that the access starts (a door sync is needed on any non-internet-connected door before the access will be added to the device. This will occur the first time a user performs an unlock using the DOOR App).</li>
<li>Once the devices have been synced, the person will be able to access the doors by using their smartphone, doorcode, or Keycard (Note: You need to independently set up a Keycard before using it). </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HAQCD86EZY9K8FTR6PEBKGQS">Editing someone's access</h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to 'People.'</li>
<li>Add, edit the expiration, or delete their Keys.</li>
<li>Sync the relevant doors (a <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Sync">Door Sync</a></strong></span> is needed on any non-internet-connected door before the access will be removed from the device).</li>
<li>Once the devices have been synced, the changes will become active (see below).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HAQCD86EAVEABV64BHY60SCG">Revoking someone's access</h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to 'People.'</li>
<li>Select the person whose access you want to revoke.</li>
<li>Select the ‘Keys’ tab under their name.</li>
<li>Click “Revoke All Keys” at the bottom.</li>
<li>Confirm that you want to revoke their access. Note that this will also revoke any guest access this user has granted.</li>
<li>Sync the relevant doors (a <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Sync">Door Sync</a></strong></span> is needed on any non-internet-connected door before the access will be removed from the device).</li>
<li>Once the devices have been synced, the person and their guests will no longer be able to access the doors.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even after revoking a person’s access, you will still be able to see them in the ‘People’ page if you have “Show Expired Users” selected. You can always grant access again at a later time.</p>
