<h3 id="h_01JA8R78PYYZT4ABTQF1CQSWJ7">Activating Latch Keycards for Your Residents</h3>
<p>You can activate and deactivate Keycards in the <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></strong></span> on behalf of your residents. Residents can also activate their own Keycard through <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://keycard.latch.com/">keycard.latch.com</a></strong></span>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JA8R7G2YVXDA93NQT7GRC54F">Activating and deactivating a Keycard on behalf of your residents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Within "DOOR OS", you can activate or deactivate a Keycard for a resident by navigating to that person's detail page, and tapping 'Activate' or 'Deactivate'.</li>
<li>Once you have activated or deactivated a Keycard, an email will be sent to the user letting them know that a Keycard has been activated or deactivated on their behalf.</li>
<li>When you activate or deactivate a Keycard, you will need to sync any doors that are not internet-connected to ensure that the Keycard has been added or removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For security reasons, if a user has access to Latch properties that are outside of your portfolio, then you will not be allowed to activate or deactivate their Keycard on their behalf. The user will then have to self-activate or deactivate as outlined below.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JA8R8Z3EWJJ2N0S5QGSGYPKQ">Resident self-activation and self-deactivation of Keycards</h3>
<p>If you'd rather your residents manage their Keycard themselves or if a resident has access to Latch devices in a property that is not in your portfolio, then they can activate and deactivate their Keycard themselves at <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://keycard.latch.com/">keycard.latch.com</a></strong></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create their access in DOOR OS.</li>
<li>Give them their Latch keycard. The card will prompt them to activate their keycard online. After activating, they must open any non-internet-connected doors with the DOOR App before their keycard will work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note: Their keycard must be activated before they open doors with the DOOR App for the first time. If they've already used the DOOR App to open their doors, they will be shown how to sync their doors with the app manually.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JA8R9ZYQJ3RMQVFHN37C3M4D">What does 'Activation/Deactivation Pending' mean?</h3>
<p>When you activate or deactivate a Keycard, the doors that the keycard user has or will have access to need to be synced to ensure the Keycard is added or removed accordingly. For internet-connected doors, this happens automatically. For non-internet-connected doors, you will need to sync those doors using the DOOR App.</p>
<ul>
<li>'Pending' means that some doors have not been synced yet to reflect the changes you made to someone's Keycard</li>
</ul>
