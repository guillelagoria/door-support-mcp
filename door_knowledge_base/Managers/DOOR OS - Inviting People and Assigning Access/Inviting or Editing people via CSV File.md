<p>With the 'Import' feature, you can upload people all at once from a CSV file, just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into the <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></span></strong>.</li>
<li>Navigate to 'People' and select 'Invite'.</li>
<li>Select 'DOOR App.'</li>
<li>Select 'Import CSV.'</li>
<li>Select 'Import.'</li>
<li>Download the CSV template to ensure your data is in the right format.</li>
<li>Choose your CSV file or drag a file into the browser window.</li>
<li>Select 'Import CSV.'</li>
<li>Review your data; if there are any issues, you can make the changes to your original CSV file and re-upload.</li>
<li>Select 'Add Contacts.'</li>
<li>Add the Keys you want them to have.</li>
<li>Optional: add a start time and expiration for your imported people.</li>
<li>Review and Send.</li>
<li>Once complete, all the people you added will receive the Door welcome email with details on using the Door app and Latch devices.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes on CSV Uploads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your data must be in CSV file format.</li>
<li>Email addresses are treated as the primary identifier of people in the DOOR system. If you're adding someone with an email address that already has a DOOR account associated with it, doors will be added to the existing account.</li>
<li>The Keys section in the CSV file is aimed at Residential doors' Keys. Any communal door' Keys should be added in step 11.</li>
<li>If, for some reason, there are problems completing the import process, the same CSV file may be uploaded again and the system will only import data that hasn’t already been processed.</li>
</ul>
