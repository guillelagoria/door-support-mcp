<h2 id="h_01K2CPDN03A1MQY7FSR3FXH6ZP"><strong>Managing OpenKit Partner Access in DOOR OS</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Authorized third-party partners use OpenKit, our set of APIs and SDK, to integrate with DOOR's smart access technology. This allows partners to create custom experiences that leverage DOOR's secure access control features.</p><h3 id="h_01K2CPCKN21BJRB3JDWE32ESTW"><strong>Adding or Removing an OpenKit Partner to Your Property</strong></h3><ul>
<li>To <strong>add</strong> an OpenKit partner to your property, send an email to <strong>integrations@door.com</strong>. This email must come from an address with property or portfolio permissions for that property. In the email, include a statement such as: "We give DOOR permission to add [Partner Name] to [Property Name]."</li>
<li>To <strong>remove</strong> an OpenKit partner from your property, first ensure the partner is unassigned from all doors they were previously assigned to. Then, send an email to <strong>integrations@door.com</strong> with your property name and the partner you wish to disable.</li>
</ul><h2 id="h_01K2CPERDY0NYQBKYAS0D2DEAG"><strong>Assigning an OpenKit Partner to a Door</strong></h2><p><br>Access for OpenKit partners is managed <strong>door by door</strong> within DOOR OS.</p><ol>
<li>From the navigation menu, click <strong>Access</strong>, then select <strong>Doors</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the specific <strong>door</strong> you wish to manage from the list.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit door</strong> button.</li>
<li>From the dropdown menu, select the <strong>partner</strong> you want to assign to this door.<ol><li>Or select “None” to <strong>remove</strong> the partner from the door</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply the changes.</li>
</ol><p>Include GIF or screenshot here showing the "Edit door" process.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: If you've removed a partner's access, perform a door update using the <strong>DOOR App </strong>on the door to ensure all access is revoked.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Partner access is assigned to individual doors, not to keys. For managing vacant units, you can either manually assign/unassign partners to specific doors, or assign all relevant vacant doors to the partner and manage access through their UI.</p><h2 id="h_01K2CPFM9HFDF196BVPJT9G5GV"><strong>Changes &amp; Considerations</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Updated "Latch" to "DOOR" and "Mission Control" to "DOOR OS" for current brand consistency.</li>
<li>Changed email to <strong>integrations@door.com</strong>.</li>
<li>Reduced length</li>
<li>Updated navigation paths in DOOR OS for accuracy (<strong>Access</strong> -&gt; <strong>Doors</strong>).</li>
<li>Included a placeholder for a GIF/screenshot to improve clarity. **If needed</li>
<li>Emphasized door-level access (not keys) and provided guidance for vacant units (FAQ).</li>
<li>Reduced to two core actions: email request for property addition and DOOR OS assignment to doors.</li>
<li>Added specific requirements for partner addition emails (permissions, phrasing).</li>
<li>Aimed to customers. Partners have the <a href="https://github.com/Latch/openkit/tree/main/documentation"><strong>documentation</strong></a> available for more details on how to use the APIs.</li>
</ul>
