<h3 id="h_01H93459ARVM9G7VMAY5S2KJ9E">Q: How does the ePMS integration work?</h3>
<p>A: The integration is a one-way data feed that pulls resident information and lease details from Yardi, RealPage, Entrata, and AppFolio hourly into the DOOR OS. This eliminates double entry for the property manager, accelerates their day-to-day workflows, and ensures any changes to this information in the property management software are synced to DOOR OS.</p>

<p>A: Full name, email, mobile number, lease-start, and lease-end dates, and move-in and move-out dates.</p>
