<h3 id="h_01J1X1H2S7B3EACDMCNH5MSYSZ">Access Review</h3>
<p>When the PMS lease status is updated and synced into DOOR, the integration will create new access suggestions based on user assignments. There are three types of access suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grant a Key (Marked in Green): Based on user assignments, the integration suggests adding these keys.</li>
<li>Revoke a Key (Marked in Red): Based on user assignments, the integration suggests revoking these keys.</li>
<li>No Changes (Marked in Grey): Based on user assignments, the integration suggests keeping these keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Property managers should review and approve access suggestions by selecting the access suggestion and clicking "Update Access." Please note that you can only select up to 50 access suggestions at a time.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1X1H2S7QVC23BC8A0S8KQC9">Discard Access Suggestion</h3>
<p>Property managers can discard access suggestions by hovering over the keys they want to discard and clicking on the "X" button. This will remove the access suggestion from the list of pending actions</p>
