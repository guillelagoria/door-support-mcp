<li>On the DOOR OS 'People' tab, you will see when the last sync with the PMS occurred.</li>

<h3 id="h_01J1X38FCC3CKKZFECKHQB6M44">Duplicate Emails</h3>
<p>Review the Duplicate Email alerts. Please note that each user must have their unique email address in DOOR. On this screen, there is a list of users in your PMS with the same email address. Users with duplicate emails are not synced from PMS to DOOR. Please adjust the email address of those users in PMS. Once adjusted, users will be imported to DOOR in the next sync.</p>

<h3 id="h_01JJW1VGJ21AQ15Q4K777TVE16">Duplicate Accounts</h3>
<p>Review the Duplicate Accounts alerts -  Duplicate accounts can cause confusion and inaccuracies between DOOR and your PMS.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1X38FCC722TFNQGVSN9QECC">Name Mismatch</h3>
<p>Name Mismatch occurs when there is a difference in the resident's name between your PMS and DOOR.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the name is correct in DOOR, update the resident's entry in PMS.</li>
<li>If the name is correct in PMS, click Merge and override the name in DOOR. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J1X38FCCHCXG1HXQZ7RW62Y7">Email Mismatch</h3>
<p>Email Mismatch occurs when a resident's email address is different between your PMS and DOOR. DOOR requires a unique email address for each user. To resolve Email Mismatch, ensure that the correct email address is associated with the correct resident account.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the email address is correct in DOOR, update the resident's entry in PMS.</li>
<li>If the email address is correct in PMS, click Create Separate and delete the old DOOR account.</li>
</ul>
