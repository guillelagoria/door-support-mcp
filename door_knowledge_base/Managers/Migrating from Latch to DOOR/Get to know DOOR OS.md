<p><strong>Who can use DOOR OS?</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Latch Mission Control, DOOR OS is available for building managers.</p>
<p><strong>Are all features in Latch Mission Control available in DOOR OS?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the existing features in Latch Mission Control will be available in DOOR OS (and more). At the moment, for creating Bookable spaces for your building, you'll still need to go through Latch Mission Control. Two-Factor Authentication is also forthcoming in DOOR, but won't be available at launch.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the new features of DOOR OS?</strong></p>
<p>With DOOR OS, you can now change the length of your property's residential locks' doorcodes and manage your DOOR Smart Home devices directly from the web tool. DOOR OS is where we'll continue to roll out new features only available in DOOR.</p>
