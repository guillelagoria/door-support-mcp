<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your intercom will show ‘Empty Directory’ when it hasn’t been able to download the Unit and resident list from the Cloud. This can happen if you haven’t added Units to your building or if the intercom cannot connect to the internet.  If this occurs, check your intercom's internet connection within DOOR.</span></p>
