<p>Managing your Portfolio means deciding who on your team needs to help manage the successful installation and management of devices at your DOOR-enabled property.  </p>
<h3 id="h_01JJVREYNSSKTPY4WWESCX21AY">What is a Portfolio Manager?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portfolio Managers have the highest level of permissions in the DOOR system. For example, they can invite and revoke people, create and edit any Key, Door, or schedule, utilize the DOOR App for installation and maintenance, and create other Portfolio and Property Managers.</span> </p>
<p>Given that this is the highest permission level (and includes the ability to add other managers), we recommend that only a few staff members receive Portfolio Management permissions. </p>
<h3 id="h_01JJVRF3HGF3XW93QW8A08WD9K">What is a Property Manager?</h3>
<p>A Property Manager may have <span style="font-weight: 400;">a variety of responsibilities at your building depending on the Key Management Permissions and Device Management permissions granted to their account. Specifically, they m</span>ay have access management permissions such as the ability to create, edit, and delete access, in addition to making, giving, and revoking access, but unlike Portfolio Managers they cannot create and delete other managers. A Property Manager can see all of the properties for which they are a Property Manager in any portfolio.</p>
<h3 id="h_01JJVRFFMYFP6T7KPPT2NF3D49">Property Manager: Key Management Permissions</h3>
<p>Whether or not a property manager can create or edit keys depends on the Key Management permissions granted to their account. Thus, before they're able to perform functions related to Keys, you'll want to ensure they have the appropriate permissions assigned to them via DOOR.</p>
<p>To view and edit key management permissions, navigate to the Settings menu on the DOOR OS and select "Staff." Since Portfolio Managers will receive full key management permissions, to view/edit your existing Property Managers' permissions, select the 'Property Managers' tab. Choose a property manager, then select 'Edit' to make changes to their Device Management or Key Management Permissions.</p>
<p>For steps on creating or deleting Property/Portfolio Managers, review the steps in this article: <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24505993010071-Adding-Editing-or-Deleting-Property-and-Portfolio-Managers">Adding, Editing, or Deleting Property and Portfolio Managers.</a></strong></span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJVRHBX8NRMT56KEZMNWBTP8">Full Key Management </h3>
<p>Managers can create, edit, delete, give, and revoke all existing and future Keys.  This is the default permission level for all Portfolio Managers. This is the only permission level that allows for creating, editing, and deleting Keys. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs.</p>
<p>- Full Key Managers can scan packages and assign them to Units/Users.</p>
<p>- Full Key Managers can access the Reports tab in DOOR OS.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FQBFBX67ZJKPXC5CD94TE2">Limited Key Management</h3>
<p id="h_01JJVRFWQNKA7X0H3M0XYR2J1W"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers can only give and revoke existing and future keys. No creating, editing, or deleting permissions. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs.</span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJVRG91P25FM3AF2HEKE5P48">Specific Key Management</h3>
<p>Managers can only give and revoke specific Keys designated to the Manager. If Specific permission is selected, you will then be prompted to select the specific keys within a given property that the manager can give and revoke. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs only for those specifically selected doors.</p>
<p>- Specific Key Managers can scan packages and assign them to Units/Users.</p>
<p>- Specific Key Managers can access the Reports tab in DOOR OS.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Remember that Key management is not the same thing as Key access. If you would like to give Key access to a Manager, you will need to 'Add a Key' to that Manager.<br><br></span></p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FQBFBXNQ1STFKZHRMS62GM">Note: Access Logs and Key Management</h3>
<p>You can only see the access logs for doors that are in the Keys that you manage. For example, if none of the Keys that you manage have 'Door 1', then you won't be able to view access logs for 'Door 1'.<br><br></p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FQBFBXY68ARHBZTWXWF85R">Property Manager: Device Management Permissions</h3>
<p>Whether or not a property manager can perform certain device management functions (such as activating/deactivating devices), Device Management permissions must be granted to their account in DOOR. </p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FQBFBX488VB063EN9PHF89">Granting/Removing Device Management Permissions</h3>
<p>To view and edit key management permissions, navigate to the Settings section in DOOR OS<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>and select "Staff." Since Portfolio Managers will receive full key management permissions, to view/edit your existing Property Managers' permissions, select the 'Property Managers' tab. Choose a property manager, then select 'Edit' to make changes to their Device Management or Key Management Permissions.</p>
<p>On a Manager’s contact card, you will see a section for ‘Device Management.' From there, you can select ‘Add Property’ to add a property to their device management permissions. When viewing this property, you will see at a glance the number of total devices within a property that you are giving the Manager permission to.</p>
<p>Managers with Device Management permissions, in general, can upgrade software, view battery life, and a list of doors requiring door syncs, all within the DOOR App. Permissions to upgrade Firmware, view battery life, and perform Door Syncs are included automatically when you add device management permissions to a manager's account. </p>

<h3 id="h_01JJVRJ3G7EFV361ZWQESHCS8N">Device Management Permissions </h3>
<p>Only managers with Device Management and ‘Activate/Deactivate’ permissions will be able to install DOOR Smart Home Devices and locks as needed. The option to install and uninstall devices is the only permission that can be manually toggled ON or OFF.</p>
