<p>Whether or not a property manager can create or edit keys depends on the Key Management permissions granted to their account. Thus, before they're able to perform functions related to Keys, you'll want to ensure they have the appropriate permissions assigned to them in DOOR.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FSKK2W8AG4R2RMX8M6JHQP">Full Key Management </h3>
<p>Managers can create, edit, delete, give, and revoke all existing and future Keys.  This is the default permission level for all Portfolio Managers. This is the only permission level that allows for creating, editing, and deleting Keys. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs.</p>
<p>- Full Key Managers can scan packages and assign them to Units/Users.</p>
<p>- Full Key Managers can access the Reports tab in DOOR OS.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FSKK2WG7V9WHHD4PAD9CYQ">Limited Key Management</h3>
<p>Managers can only give and revoke existing and future keys. No creating, editing, or deleting permissions. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FSKK2WYF48V67PYZXCSZTH">Specific Key Management</h3>
<p>Managers can only give and revoke specific Keys designated to the Manager. If Specific permission is selected, you will then be prompted to select the specific keys within a given property that the manager can give and revoke. This permission also allows the Manager to view access logs only for those specifically selected doors.</p>
<p>- Specific Key Managers can scan packages and assign them to Units/Users.</p>
<p>- Specific Key Managers can access the Reports tab in DOOR OS.</p>
<p>Note: Remember that Key management is not the same as Key access. If you would like to give a Manager key access, you will need to 'Add a Key' to that Manager.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FSKK2W67H514AC91VFVYST">Note: Access Logs and Key Management</h3>
<p>You can only see the access logs for doors that are in the Keys that you manage. For example, if none of the Keys that you manage have 'Door 1', then you won't be able to view access logs for 'Door 1'.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1FSKK2WS5AD27PSJ0RTYF6V">Property Manager: Device Management Permissions</h3>
<p>Whether or not a property manager can perform certain device management functions (such as activating/deactivating devices), Device Management permissions must be granted to their account in DOOR. </p>
<p>Managers with Device Management permissions, in general, can upgrade software, view battery life, and a list of doors requiring door syncs, all within the DOOR App. Permissions to upgrade Firmware, view battery life, and perform door syncs are included automatically when you add device management permissions to a manager's account. </p>
<p>Only managers with Device Management and ‘Activate/Deactivate’ permissions will be able to install DOOR Smart Home Devices and locks as needed. The option to install and uninstall devices is the only permission that can be manually toggled ON or OFF.</p>

<p>Note that on a Manager contact card, you will see a section for ‘Device Management.' From there, you can select ‘Add Property’ to add a property to their device management permissions. When viewing this property, you will see at a glance the number of total devices within a property that you are giving the Manager permission to.</p>
