<p>If you manage a DOOR-enabled property, you'll want to understand and set up a few key concepts to activate hardware and assign access.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J0PFATV0EACWCQCVG44JX1E0">Doors </h3>
<p id="h_01J0PFBJ7D1RM7DCHSDR80YY5X">Doors are the digital representation of Latch locks and creating doors is a necessary step before (or during) the installation of Latch hardware. </p>
<h3 id="h_01JZ8BS94AGMH3Z32FJ7Z7AXV9">Door Types</h3>
<p>There are various types of doors, and it's crucial to label them correctly to ensure the appropriate level of privacy for individuals in a building. Once a device is linked to a door, the type of door cannot be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Building Entrance: Typically used for entryways, vestibules, and other passages from the exterior to the interior of a building.</li>
<li>Residence: Designated for doors leading directly to someone's private space, like an apartment or home. Access logs for private doors assigned to users marked as "Resident" will remain private.</li>
<li>Service: Intended for doors leading to maintenance areas or places restricted to residents, such as elevator rooms and storage closets.</li>
<li>Communal: Used for doors leading to shared or community spaces accessible to most residents, like gyms and lounges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J182MH5NZ3Q2SFCAE6HG39YP">Units</h3>
<p>Units enable users to be listed in the intercom directory and are useful for linking smart devices to particular apartments. Ideally, your unit list should align with your apartment door list, which can be imported via CSV. Users can be linked to a unit on their profile page, which will then display them in the intercom directory under that specific unit. It's important to note that associating units with doors does not automatically grant access to the door; access permissions are managed by adding keys to a user's account.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J182MH5NB34D9XC2XT34BJVK">Keys</h3>
<p>Keys are similar to folders containing one or more doors. Granting a user access to a key automatically gives them access to all the doors within that key. Any settings applied to a key will affect all users assigned to that key. For instance, a key named 'Resident Key' could provide access to building entrances and amenities for new residents. This key might have schedules restricting access to certain amenities during specific hours.</p>
