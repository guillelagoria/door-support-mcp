<p>Property managers can add settings to disable doorcodes and access sharing to restrict guests from entering certain amenity spaces. Spaces where doorcodes and access sharing are disabled will still allow residents to use their DOOR App or Keycard to unlock these spaces, but will prevent them from inviting guests or receiving a doorcode for doors with this setting. We do not recommend restricting these features for residential doors.</p>

<p>When inviting a resident, you can disable the “May Share Key” feature for certain amenity spaces. </p>
<p>To disable this feature, navigate to the resident’s detail page (DOOR OS &gt; People &gt; Select the desired user).</p>
<ol>
<li>Select “Keys”</li>
<li>Select the Key that you would like to turn off access sharing for</li>
<li>Toggle off “May Share Key” </li>
<li>Save your changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Once changes are saved, residents will no longer be able to share access with guests for designated doors. </p>
<h3 id="h_01H9GNABDM9SE745TBQJD5RV0V">How to disable Doorcodes</h3>
<p>Property managers can disable doorcodes to prevent residents from sharing their personal doorcodes with guests to access certain amenity spaces. </p>
<p>When disabling this feature, this will deactivate doorcode access for any selected doors in a Key and affect all keyholders. It’s important to ensure that doors are not selected that residents should have doorcode access to, such as the building entrance or their individual unit, as their doorcode serves as a backup entry option that doesn't require their phone. </p>
<p>To disable this feature: </p>
<ol>
<li>When creating a <em>new</em> Key, ensure that “Provide Doorcodes” is turned off for any doors that should not have a doorcode provided to key holders. </li>
<li>For existing Keys, simply navigate to the desired Key, go to the doors section, and tap “Edit” to make changes to each door as desired before saving the changes. Note that you can 'bulk' disable doorcodes by selecting 'Disable All Doorcodes' on the top right-hand side. </li>
</ol>
