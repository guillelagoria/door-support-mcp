<h3 id="h_01J1AF162M75H1K4T3EZVKHHY2">What is a Door Schedule?</h3>
<p>Door Schedules offer Portfolio and Property Managers (with Full Key management permissions) the ability to schedule <span style="font-weight: 400;">devices to be unlocked on a regular schedule. This feature is different from Key Schedules because, with a Door Schedule, the Latch device will remain unlocked during the allotted days/times, meaning no Door credential is required to unlock the door. For this reason, it's typically used for commercial spaces or leasing offices where walk-ins are encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Managers can program their Schedules with specific exception schedules during the year to account for holidays. Optionally, Managers can implement First Unlock to ensure that a door does not switch to unlocked without a user unlocking it first, and/or Early Closure, which allows all users with access to the Door to lock it early.</span></p>
<h3 id="h_01JJSXFWKESC5ZCCSPN6E41HT4">Are my Latch R devices compatible with Door Schedules?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To set up Door Schedules, you will need at least one R2 device in your building on Firmware Version 4.0.1 or later, and you will only be able to apply the door schedule to those devices.Â </span></p>
<h3 id="h_01J1AF162M382WP6QA5ARTR16S" class="p-rich_text_section">To Set Up a Door Schedule:</h3>
<ol class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Navigate to 'Settings' on the DOOR OS and select 'Schedules' from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Select 'Create Schedule.'</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Name your Schedule (you can apply the same schedule to as many doors as you'd like, so we recommend naming it for that group of doors, such as "Entrances," "Amenities," or "Offices.")</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Optionally choose to enable '</span>First Unlock' or 'Early Closure' or both.
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li>'First Unlock' means that your schedule will not unlock your Door until someone with access unlocks it. Once they unlock, the door schedule will keep the Door unlocked until the scheduled interval ends.</li>
<li>'Early Closure' means that all users with access to the Door can end the schedule early, and lock the Door before the end of a scheduled interval. This is great if you want your team to be able to lock the office early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Select 'Continue.'</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Set your 'Primary Schedule' and any 'Exception Schedules.'
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 'Primary Schedule' applies each week on a rotating basis. You can choose not to set a schedule for a particular day, in which case the Door will remain locked during that entire time. If you enable a schedule for a day, you can create up to 8 schedule intervals. During these intervals, the Door will remain unlocked. You must ensure that your schedules do not overlap.</span></li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 'Exception Schedule' applies to a specific day of the year and overwrites the entire daily schedule for that day. You can only have one exception per day, and you can only create exception schedules for days up to one year out. At this time, exception schedules do not roll over year after year, so you will need to <strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://support.door.com/hc/en-us/articles/24658744817303-How-to-perform-a-Door-Sync">Sync</a></span></strong> them.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select 'Continue.'</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Select the Doors to add to your Schedule.
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can add as many Doors as you'd like; however, a Door can only have one Schedule on it. You can also change the Door Schedule by navigating to the Door page and choosing the Schedule there.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Select 'Complete.'</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Once the Door has been synced, the Schedule will be applied.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01JJSWZB4FB4XRF44SBNSHEQYD">Syncing the Door after creating a Door Schedule</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Door is connected to the internet via WiFi, Ethernet, Hub, or Intercom, the Door will automatically sync. Note that doors can take up to 30 minutes to sync based on traffic.</span></p>
<p><strong>Please remember that to apply these changes, you must sync all affected doors that are not connected to the internet. To sync a door, simply select the door name while being within Bluetooth range of the Latch device, and then choose the "Sync" option.</strong></p>
