<p>To activate a Latch device on a physical door, you need to start by creating a digital representation of the door:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong><a href="https://app.door.com/">DOOR OS</a></strong></span>.</li>
<li>Go to Access.</li>
<li>Select 'Doors', and click on 'Add Door'.</li>
<li>Name the door. <br>This name will be displayed in the DOOR App, so be sure to give your door a clear label (e.g., Pool, Gym, Front Entrance, 202, Unit 202, Garage).</li>
<li>Choose the appropriate door type. <br>Selecting the correct door type is crucial to ensure that each resident's privacy at residential doors is maintained. Choose from the following options:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Building Entrance</strong>: Typically used for entryways, vestibules, and other passages from the exterior to the interior of a building.</li>
<li>
<strong>Residence</strong>: Designated for doors leading directly to someone's private space, like an apartment or home. Access logs for private doors assigned to users marked as "Resident" will remain private.</li>
<li>
<strong>Service</strong>: Intended for doors leading to maintenance areas or places restricted to residents, such as elevator rooms and storage closets.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communal</strong>: Used for doors leading to shared or community spaces accessible to most residents, like gyms and lounges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've created your door(s) you can activate Latch devices to them during the installation process (until then, the door will remain 'uninstalled'). Once installation is complete, any people you have added to the door (by granting them a key that holds the door) in advance will now have access. </p>
