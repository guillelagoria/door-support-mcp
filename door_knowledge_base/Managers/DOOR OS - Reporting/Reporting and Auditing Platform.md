<p>The DOOR's Reporting and Auditing Platform provides managers access to building data to drive efficiency and reliability when auditing staff, resident permissions, devices, administrators, and more throughout a property.</p>
<p>Within DOOR, Property Managers can access reports all in a single place and automated reports allow users to easily filter, sort, search, and export files. The Reporting and Auditing feature helps to eliminate human error and provides a clean auditing trail to view Admin, Users, Key, and Devices reports.</p>
<p>To view the reports within DOOR, go to the upper right-hand corner of the screen,and  click 'Reports.'</p>
