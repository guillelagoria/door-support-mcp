<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We designed Latch devices so you can easily and securely enter your space and share access with those you trust. For peace of mind, some Latch devices have a camera on their exterior that takes photos in specific situations while preserving your privacy, so you can check who entered your space and when (Latch C, Latch M, and Latch R). The Latch C2, current Latch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">M, and E-Genius Powered by Latch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do not have a camera.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latch devices with cameras on private unit doors only take photos under specific circumstances, namely during a failed/incorrect doorcode attempt and when someone uses a daily doorcode. Latch devices at private unit doors do not capture photos during DOOR App (Bluetooth) unlocks, mechanical key unlocks, keycard unlocks, or doorcode unlocks that are not 24-hour daily doorcodes (i.e., no photos are taken if a user utilizes the doorcode provided with DOOR App access).</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the security of the building, Latch devices at common area/public doors take photos of the following unlock events regardless of user type (resident, guest, accounts with property management permissions): </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOOR App (Bluetooth) unlocks, 24-hour daily doorcode unlocks, and doorcode unlocks that are not tied to 24-hour daily doorcodes.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J1ZFSR21EKB7A7AP3N97HANN"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who can see the photos?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have resident status, photos at your private unit door are visible only to you, other users with resident status at your private unit door, and authorized building personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lens on the R, M, and C devices is not capable of taking video.</span></p>
<h3 id="h_01J1ZFSR21N63PJ2WV2HVMCNRY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there an interior camera on my Latch device? Can DOOR see inside my apartment?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, there is no interior camera on any Latch device, and DOOR cannot see inside your apartment. </span></p>
