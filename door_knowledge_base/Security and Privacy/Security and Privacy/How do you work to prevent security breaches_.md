<p>This is being reviewed by JJ:<br>We’ve approached security from every angle to reduce the risk of malicious activity. We continuously test our hardware and software against potential threat models and frameworks to get ahead of potential risks and are committed to making software updates if and when vulnerabilities are detected. Additionally, we’ve taken steps to ensure that access information is protected: encrypting data on our devices as well as on our back-end servers, building in strong authentication and data leakage provisions, and more. </p>
<p>First, our offline-first design approach means that our Latch M, e-Genius Powered by Latch, and C devices do not require internet connectivity to unlock. Operating independently from the internet provides an extra layer of security against malicious actors and keeping residents’ data safe.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to running internal static, unit, and integration tests, we partner with third-party firms to run periodic penetration tests and validate our product architecture and design. We also use a variety of security monitoring tools to detect risks in real-time and test new features and products in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, ‍Latch devices are designed to get better every day. Because all our products can be upgraded via Bluetooth, we’re able to roll out the latest security features and fixes quickly and easily.</p>
